<h2 id="conceptsnotes">Concepts/Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>All locations have been given to them at the start of the race, but its encoded. <br>
<ul><li>Teams will be given instructions to decode. Once they have decrypted the location, they must then go there, complete the station to be given instructions to decoding the next location.</li>
<li>Station Leaders: when they arrive at your station, you may choose to have them show their work on decoding. You can choose to not let them proceed until work is shown (or they understand what is goind on).</li>
<li>It should not be too hard (I hope), as there are examples provided with the instructions. Should it be too hard they can ask for a hint or message me for details.</li></ul></li>
<li>All locations are new. Each one is near a subway station and from there either be a walk or one additional streetcar.</li>
<li>Format is points based. Each station has a total of 50 points (with some bonuses) and arriving at the finish line will also receive points. The team with the most points wins. Ties will be broken by tiebreaker question at the end. <br>
<ul><li>The points breakdown is a secret until the end of the race.</li></ul></li>
<li>All stations are designed to be roughly 30 minutes. There is no hard time limit, and they can choose not to complete the task (which gives them no points). <br>
<ul><li>Technically, they can stay as long or as little as they want. If they are really stuck it would probably be best for them to move on. Simply arriving and leaving the station gives them 20 points.</li>
<li>With that said, teams can only submit once (with the exception of physical challenges at Stations B &amp; E).</li></ul></li>
<li>Lunch is done along the way. Recomended time is to have lunch before entering High Park (Station D), as there may not be food services available at High Park.</li>
<li>Cutoff is at 1700. Instructions to get to the end is with the Team Leaders.</li>
<li>At the end, their time is stopped once they’ve handed in the puzzles and the feedback page. <br>
<ul><li>Additional points are awarded for teams that finish. The earlier you finish, the more points earned.</li>
<li>They may still continue with the puzzles, but they will still be timed.</li></ul></li>

<p><strong>Expected Arrival Time</strong>: 0900</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong>: <br>
- Teams will be given an instuructions/rules sheet in the form of fill in the blanks/true or false/multiple choice. <br>
- Once they’ve completed the questions, they must then find the team leader with the correct arrangement of 2x2 hands (each team leader is holding a 12x12 grid). <br>
- Once they’ve found the correct leader (the leader has to verify), the leader then checks their answers. If correct, the team leader passes on the decoding sheet. If answers are wrong, they must try again.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring</strong>: None.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="station-a">Station A</h3>

<p><strong>Location</strong>: Scarborough Civic Centre Library. You can either be inside the library or just outside the front doors.</p>

<p><strong>Expected Arrival Time</strong>: 0920</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong>: <br>
- When teams arrive, you may ask them to show their decoding work. The phrase is <code>TORONTO'S ONE HUNDREDTH LIBRARY</code>. If you are satisfied, they may continue. <br>
- After marking their time (using the app), find their sheet, mark the same time, and pass the sheet to them. <br>
- You can remind them the following: <br>
  - There is no time limit. Recommended time is 30 mins. <br>
  - You can only submit once. <br>
- Once they have submitted, mark their time on the sheet, record the time on the app, and hand them their decoding instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring</strong>: Points are denoted in square brackets. <br>
1. [10] Arrive at Station A <br>
2. [10] 52 upright beams <br>
3. [10] Dedicated to the teams, groups, and individuals who have brought honour to the borough by their efforts in provincial, national or international competition. <br>

<h3 id="station-b">Station B</h3>

<p><strong>Location</strong>: Billy Bishop Airport. Subway to Union Station, then 509 Harboufront to Bathurst Street. Then walk to airport and go through the tunnel. Go up the escalator and there should be a seating area on the right.</p>

<p><strong>Expected Arrival Time</strong>: 1135</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong>: <br>
- When teams arrive, you may ask them to show their decoding work. The phrase is <code>BILLY BISHOP AIRPORT</code>. If you are satisfied, they may continue. <br>
- After marking their time (using the app), find their sheet, mark the same time, and pass the sheet to them. <br>
- The general idea is to move everyone from one side to the other. The four passengers each have restrictions <br>
- They can only move either zero or one person at a time. After movement, the following restrictions must be met: <br>
  - Clumsy archaeologist cannot be with Mummy by his/herself; If the senior archaeologist is there then it is fine. <br>
  - Thief cannot be with any of the archaeologists by his/herself; If the pilot is on the same side then it is fine. <br>
  - As long as these restrictions are met, any other scenarios is fine. <br>
- The goal is to do this in the least number of moves possible (answer below). Your job is to track the number of moves (Moving the plane back with no passengers is valid and still counts as a move). They may try as many times as they wish, but the most recent attempt will be recorded. <br>
- Once they are satisfied, mark their time and number of moves on the sheet, record the time on the app, and hand them their decoding instructions. <br>
- You can remind them the following: <br>
  - There is no time limit. Recommended time is 30 mins. <br>
  - You can attempt as many times as you wish, but the most recent attempt will be recorded.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring</strong>: Points are in square brackets. <br>
1. [10] Arrive at Station B <br>
2. [57-3*x] Where x is the total number of moves. The optimal number of moves is 9, So the highest score they can get is 30. Subtracts 3 points for every extra move made, down to 0. <br>
3. [10] Left Station B</p>

<p>Total: 50 points</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: The best solution is 9 moves.</p>
