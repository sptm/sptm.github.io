<ul>
<li>
<strong>NEW (Optional Station)</strong>: This year there will be 5 stations plus one optional station.
<ul>
<li>This optional station will not have a station leader and can be completed at any time during the race (but before cutoff time). The idea is to have the teams make the decision of whether to split off from the current path to gain more points.</li>
<li>A station sheet would be given to them with the questions they will need to answer. They will submit this sheet at the end of the race.</li>
<li>If teams are finished all 5 stations and there is still time before 1645 cutoff, suggest them to do the optional station.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>NEW (Station/Transit Pass)</strong>: Each team will get to choose one 'hint' or shortcut. They will need to decide which one to get at the beginning of the race.
<ul>
<li>The station pass, when used, would allow them to complete an easier version of the station. They will not know how it will be easier until the choose to use the pass at that station.</li>
<li>The transit pass, when used, would given them transit directions from one location to another.</li>
<li>These passes can only be used once, cannot be applied to the optional station and is worth zero points if kept until the end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Format is points based. Each station has a total of 50 points (with some bonuses) and arriving at the finish line will also receive points. The team with the most points wins. Ties will be broken by tiebreaker question at the end.</li>
<li>All stations are designed to be roughly 30 minutes. There is no hard time limit, and they can choose not to complete the task (which gives them no points).
<ul>
<li>Technically, they can stay as long or as little as they want. If they are really stuck it would probably be best for them to move on. Simply arriving and leaving the station gives them 20 points.</li>
<li>With that said, teams can only submit once (with the exception of physical challenges at Stations B &amp; D).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lunch is done after Station C, at HTO Park by Harbourfront. On this day, there is a Waterfront Artisan Market where they can buy food. If not, they can walk about a block in either direction for Tims, Subway and Pizza Pizza.</li>
<li>Cutoff is at 1645. Instructions to get to the end is with the Team Leaders.</li>
<li>At the end, their time is stopped once they've handed in the puzzles and the feedback page.
<ul>
<li>Additional points are awarded for teams that finish. The earlier you finish, the more points earned.</li>
<li>They may still continue with the puzzles, but they will still be timed.</li>
</ul>

<a id="user-content-locationsdirections" class="anchor" href="#locationsdirections" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Locations/Directions</h2>
<p>Directions are based of the teams running the race.</p>
<p><strong>Start</strong>: STC</p>
<ul>
<li>In front of the theatres</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Station A</strong>: Toronto Reference Library</p>
<ul>
<li>Subway to Bloor-Yonge, then head north to the library.</li>
<li>Station leaders should sit by the tables by the edge so they can be seen from the center.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Station B</strong>: Ryerson's Kerr Hall Field</p>
<ul>
<li>Subway to Dundas, then head to northeast to the field inside Kerr Hall</li>
<li>Station leaders should have a seat on the hill or on the benches around</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Station C</strong>: HTO Park by Harbourfront</p>
<ul>
<li>Subway to Union, then take 509/510 streetcar and stop at Rees Street. Cross the street then walk a little bit west.</li>
<li>Station leaders should either sit by the hills or by the sand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Station D</strong>: Cherry Beach</p>
<ul>
<li>Two options, both of which requires taking 121C eastbound.
<ul>
<li>Take 510 heading up and stopping at Bremner Blvd, then take 121C</li>
<li>Or streetcar back to Union station, exit the station and wait for the 121C at Bay and Front (Southeast corner)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Station leaders should sit by a place with pile-able sand (ie. dry sand that is playable). Hopefully there is space by the far end of the parking lot (Closer one is currently swamped last time I checked).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Station E</strong>: Distillery District</p>
<ul>
<li>If coming up from Cherry Beach: Take 121C back up and stop at Mill street. It would say 'Detour on Route' because of construction on the actual Mill Street, so it will actually drop you off at Parliament Street</li>
<li>Otherwise, you can take a 514 streetcar eastbound which would drop you off at the Distillery streetcar loop.</li>
<li>Station leaders should sit by the large flask/beaker sculpture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End</strong>: Milliken Park Community Recreation Center</p>
<ul>
<li>Simpliest way that doesn't involve switching is to take the 514 streetcar to King Station, then head to Finch and take 53 eastbound.
<ul>
<li>Can also decide to go to STC and take 129, but there is subway closure on Line 3, so hopefully they know this.</li>
<li>Can also walk up to King to be able to catch 504 streetcar in addition to 514, but I'm not sure how much additional time would be saved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-web-app" class="anchor" href="#web-app" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Web App</h2>
<ul>
<li>Used last year and still most likely buggy; try not to break it please (you can try after the race).</li>
<li>Usernames and passwords are given out with the respective packages.</li>
<li>Using the browser's refresh page will most likely log you out; use the provided refresh button or swap between pages.</li>
<li>Front page: overall progress of the teams. Has timestamps for when teams arrived and left the stations.</li>
<li>Station Leaders: each station has its own page; will be visible with appropriate username/password.
<ul>
<li>The station's instructions as well as the scoring will be on this page.</li>
<li>When a team arrives, click on the appropriate team and click 'Arrived'.</li>
<li>When a team leaves, click on 'Left'.</li>
<li>You can only enter a score after the team has left. You can change the score if you entered it incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Team Leaders: each team has its own page. This page only contains the progress of your team. Is only visible with appropriate username/password.
<ul>
<li>When your team has reached the end location, you must then use the page and click 'Finish Race'. [NOTE: You can only do so once they have handed over the feedback page and the puzzles. They can still continue with the puzzles, but they are still being timed.]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the event that the web app is down:
<ul>
<li>Use this page as backup for information.</li>
<li>Station Leaders: mark down the scores (either on this page or on their sheets)</li>
<li>Team Leaders: mark down their finish times on the feedback page.</li>
